# Fix 'post_date' in Woocommerce variation product from 'post_date' of father
## Usage:
* Do a backup of your db.
* Create a folder called sync-variation-dates in your /wp-content/plugins/ directory
* Download the zip file from GitHub:
* Copy https://github.com/jacopobonomi/fix_post_date_woocommerce_product_variation/archive/main.zip
* Extract the files to your newly created /wp-content/plugins/sync-variation-dates/ folder
* Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
* Go to Tools â†’ Sync Variation Dates
* Click the "Synchronize Dates" button


### Why i need that:
If you usa a plugin like "Products By Attributes & Variations for WooCommerce" or "WPC Show Single Variations for WooCommerce", and you need to order the products from date, you can use that to fix variation order.

It is really a simple function, but make a backup of the db anyway.
